## Overview
This project is an n-puzzle solver using the A* algorithm in C++, part of the 42 curriculum. It allows you to experiment with different algorithms and heuristics while demonstrating performance optimizations in C++.

Key features include:

- Supports multiple algorithms: Standard A*, Greedy, and Uniform Cost Search
- Multiple heuristics: Manhattan Distance, Misplaced Tiles, Gaschnig, and Linear Conflict
- Terminal display with colored tiles based on distance to goal
- Automatic solvability check
- Efficient heap-based priority queue for pathfinding
- Memory pool usage to reduce allocation overhead
